                But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an
                alien to it, but it is also a fiend to its own
                off-spring; worse than the Persian host who murdered
                his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself
                hath spawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in
                the jungle overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes
                even the mightiest whales against the rocks, and
                leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks
                of ships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it.
                Panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has
                lost its rider, the masterless ocean overruns the
                globe.

                Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most
                dreaded creatures glide under water, unapparent for
                the most part, and treacherously hidden beneath the
                loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish
                brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless
                tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many
                species of sharks. Consider, once more, the universal
                cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon
                each other, carrying on eternal war since the world
                began.

                My younger brother was in London when the Martians
                fell at Woking. He was a medical student working for
                an imminent examination, and he heard nothing of the
                arrival until Saturday morning. The morning papers on
                Saturday contained, in addition to lengthy special
                articles on the planet Mars, on life in the planets,
                and so forth, a brief and vaguely worded telegram, all
                the more striking for its brevity.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had
                killed a number of people with a quick-firing gun, so
                the story ran. The telegram concluded with the words:
                "Formidable as they seem to be, the Martians have not
                moved from the pit into which they have fallen, and,
                indeed, seem incapable of doing so. Probably this is
                due to the relative strength of the earth's
                gravitational energy." On that last text their
                leader-writer expanded very comfortingly.
